## What is Working

### Topologies

Full Network  
Line  
Random 2D Grid  
3D torus Grid  
Honeycomb  
Honeycomb with a random neighbor

### Algorithms

Gossip  
Push-Sum

## Largest Network

 | Topology | Gossip | Push-Sum
---|---|---
 | Full Network | 700 |10000
 | Random 2D | 800 | 3000
 | Line | 500 | 1000
 | 3DTorus | 10000  | 20000
| Honeycomb | 10000  | 30000
| RandHoneycomb | 10000 |30000

Due to the limited memory and quality of code, the performance of push-sum is better than that of gossip.
